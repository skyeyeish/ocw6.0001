# ocw6.0001
This repository contains class notes and code from open courseware lecture 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python.

Why am i doing this course even though i already know python?
I am doing it to revise my concepts once again before heading to another course and also i think i lack confidence while writing the code myself so this course should help me overcome that.
I will be including the code file for all the problem sets.
