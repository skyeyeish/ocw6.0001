LECTURE 1:
type of knowledge:
1. declarative knowledge (statement of fact) (like the end result or declaration of a variable)
  eg. someone will be selected for the job role and paid.
2. imperative knowledge (recipe or algorithm or "how to?") (how to get the output from the variable : steps)
  eg. 1. students sign up for the placement drive
      2. give test
      3. give interview
      4. company chooses the candidate with highest score in all tests and interviews
Aspects of language:
Syntax Analysis : checks the structure of the statement
eg. 
English : cat dog boy -> invalid syntax (noun noun noun).
          boy hugs dog -> valid syntax (noun verb noun).

Programming Language : "hi"5 -> invalid syntax
                       3.2*5 -> syntactically valid

Static Sematics : syntactically valid strings have meaning.
                  a sentence could be syntactically correct but have sematic error.
eg.
English : "I are hungry" -> syntactically valid but static sematic error
Programming Language : 3.2*5 -> syntactically valid
                       3 + "hi" ->static sematic error
